# SMOBench Project Status

## Current Status: Dataset Organization and Framework Setup Complete

### Completed Tasks ✅

#### Dataset Reorganization
- **Dataset Structure**: Successfully reorganized SMOBench dataset into standardized format
  - `withGT/`: 3M_Simulation, Human_Lymph_Nodes, Human_Tonsils, Mouse_Embryos_S1/S2
  - `woGT/`: Mouse_Spleen, Mouse_Thymus, Mouse_Brain variants
- **Data Info Generation**: Created 49 dataset information files with metadata
- **Quality Verification**: Confirmed all h5ad files are accessible and properly structured

#### Documentation Framework
- **CLAUDE.md**: Comprehensive development standards and project guidelines
- **docs/brief.md**: Detailed project overview and research objectives
- **docs/workflow.md**: Complete experimental workflow and execution pipeline
- **docs/setup.md**: Environment configuration and installation instructions

#### Code Organization Assessment
- **Methods Analysis**: Reviewed existing implementations in Methods/ directory
- **Scripts Structure**: Identified script organization needs in Scripts/ directory  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Analyzed current evaluation code in Eval/ directory
- **Utilities Review**: Assessed universal clustering requirements

### In Progress 🔄

#### Project Structure Optimization
- **Script Reorganization**: Moving scattered scripts from Eval/ and Methods/ to Scripts/
- **Universal Clustering**: Implementing unified clustering interface for all methods
- **PBS Template System**: Creating automated batch job generation framework

#### Method Integration Standardization
- **SpatialGlue**: Existing implementation in Scripts/integration/SpatialGlue/
- **SpaMosaic**: Implementation available but needs integration testing
- **PRAGA**: Method code exists, requires execution script standardization
- **COSMOS & PRESENT**: Integration testing and script standardization needed

### Next Priority Tasks 🎯

#### Immediate (Next Session)
1. **Complete Universal Clustering**: Implement Utils/SMOBench_clustering.py with all clustering methods
2. **Script Migration**: Move evaluation and visualization scripts to Scripts/ directory
3. **PBS Generation**: Create template-based batch job generation system
4. **Method Testing**: Validate each integration method with sample datasets

#### Short Term (1-2 Sessions)  
1. **Evaluation Pipeline**: Implement comprehensive metric calculation framework
2. **Visualization System**: Create standardized plotting functions for all results
3. **Batch Processing**: Test full pipeline on subset of datasets
4. **Quality Control**: Verify reproducibility and correctness of all components

#### Medium Term (3-5 Sessions)
1. **Full Benchmark Execution**: Run complete benchmark across all methods and datasets
2. **Result Analysis**: Generate comprehensive performance comparisons
3. **Statistical Testing**: Implement significance testing and confidence intervals
4. **Documentation Completion**: Finalize all documentation and user guides

### Technical Debt and Issues 🔧

#### Known Issues
1. **Duplicate Gene Names**: Need var_names_make_unique() in preprocessing pipeline
2. **PBS Redundancy**: Current PBS files are highly repetitive (60+ similar files)
3. **Relative Paths**: Some scripts use problematic relative path handling
4. **R Dependencies**: mclust clustering requires rpy2 interface setup

#### Performance Concerns
1. **Memory Usage**: Large h5ad files may cause memory issues on some systems
2. **GPU Allocation**: Need better GPU management for concurrent method execution
3. **Storage Space**: Full results may require 100GB+ storage

### Environment Status 🔧

#### Conda Environment: smobench
- **Status**: Active and functional
- **Key Packages**: numpy, pandas, scanpy, torch (confirmed working)
- **Missing**: Some method-specific dependencies may need installation
- **R Interface**: rpy2 needs verification for mclust clustering

#### GPU Resources
- **Availability**: Multiple GPUs accessible via nvidia-smi
- **Usage**: Use CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES for GPU allocation
- **Memory**: Monitor usage to prevent OOM errors

### Risk Assessment ⚠️

#### Low Risk
- Dataset integrity and accessibility
- Basic method implementations exist
- Core Python environment is stable

#### Medium Risk  
- R interface dependencies for mclust
- GPU memory management for large datasets
- Script coordination across different methods

#### High Risk
- None identified at current stage
